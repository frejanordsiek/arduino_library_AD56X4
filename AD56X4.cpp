   The Analog Devices AD56X4 are Quad channel 1X-bit Digital to
   Analog Converter (DAC) controlled by SPI. It can use an external
   reference or its own internal reference if present (an R is
   appended to the chip name) and has various shutdown modes for
   each channel. Each channel has separate DAC (output) and input
   (buffer) registers and commands exist to set just the input
   register, assign the input to the DAC, or set both.
   
   The chip is an SPI slave that expects SPI_MODE1 for its polarity
   and phase (read on falling edge and clock low while idle) that
   can operate at up to 50 MHz, which is far above what the arduino
   can do (8 MHz for the Uno). The DIN, SCLK, and SYNC pins in the
   chip documentation correspond to the Arduino MOSI, SCK, and SS
   pins (doesn't have to use the SS for the arduino, but it is a
   a reasonable default pin). Messages must be sent MSB first and
   are 24 bits. The first two bits are junk and are ignored. The
   next three bits are the command bits, which tell the DAC what
   operation to do. The next three bits are the address bits, which
   tells what channel (or all) should be set. The last two whole
   bytes are a word specifying the value to set the appropriate
   register on the DAC channel if setting a channel, or other needed
   information if doing another sort of command. For the 14-bit and
   12-bit chips, the last 2 and 4 bits respectively are ignored if
   an input or DAC register is being set. The command bits and address
   bits are
   
   Command bits
   | C2 | C1 | C0 | Command
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   | 0  | 0  | 0  | Write to input register N
   | 0  | 0  | 1  | Update DAC register N
   | 0  | 1  | 0  | Write to input register N and update on all
   | 0  | 1  | 1  | Write to and update channel N
   | 1  | 0  | 0  | Power up-down
   | 1  | 0  | 1  | Reset
   | 1  | 1  | 0  | Set LDAC register
   | 1  | 1  | 1  | Internal reference on/off (if present)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Address bits
   | A2 | A1 | A0 | Channel/s
   --------------------------
   | 0  | 0  | 0  | A
   | 0  | 0  | 1  | B
   | 0  | 1  | 0  | C
   | 0  | 1  | 1  | D
   | 1  | 1  | 1  | All
   --------------------------
   
   For the power up-down command, the power mode specified with
   data bits DB5 and DB4 are applied to the channels specified by
   ones in the bit mask made by DB3 to DB0 (in channel D to A
   order). The power modes are
   
   Power up-down mode
   | DB5 | DB4 | mode
   ------------------------------
   |  0  |  0  | normal operation
   |  0  |  1  | 1k to ground
   |  1  |  0  | 100k to ground
   |  1  |  1  | tri-state
   ------------------------------
   
   For the reset command, DB0 controls exactly what is reset.
   Regardless of its value, the input and DAC registers are all
   reset to zero. If DB0 is set to one; then the LDAC register
   is reset to zero, all channels powered up to normal mode, and
   the internal reference turned off (means external reference is
   used).
   
   For the set LDAC register command, whether to just set the DAC
   register to the input register every time it is changed or not,
   is set for each channel with DB3 to DB0 corresponding to channel
   D through A. A zero means that setting the input register does
   not automatically set the DAC register (value isn't written out
   as output yet) and a one means that the DAC register (and hence
   the output) is set the the input register the moment the input
   register is changed.
   
   For the internal reference on/off command, setting DB0 to zero
   turns it off and setting it to one turns it on. When off, the
   external reference is used as the voltage reference. This
   command only works in the R versions that have an internal
   reference.
